Final Project CSC324 

Our goal in making this webpage is to be able to have the marvel movies listed with a sort dropdown that allows the user to sort the movie titles from the marvel phases by either Alphabetical A-Z,  by the phase (phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, or phase 4), by the box office value, by marvel sequence, by release day sequence, or by the source rotten tomatos which assigns a score by their tomato meter and by the audience.  For each movie title we will assign a hyperlink which will take you from the home page to the appropriate movie page.  Inside the movie page we will include a table which lists out the moves poster which includes an href to the movies trailer, title, main actor(s, number in the marvel sequence, order of release date, box office money that brought in on openning weekend, and rotten tomatos score.  inside the body of each html page we have general information about the movie itself.
